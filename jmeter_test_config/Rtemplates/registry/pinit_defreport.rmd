# Initializer script for default report (per single test run).
#
# NOTE: This report checks report.id variable that can be redefined by other
# plugins, so normally it should be the last one in configuration
# sequence (have smallest order number).
#
# It doesn't make any assumptions what plugins were activated and
# just provides historical data and SLA results storages for them.
#
# Report resources are also configured here.
#
# This plugin doesn't have any associated handler, so all event files
# in plugin folder will be ignored.
